        <p>The Suzuki Swift is a supermini car (B-segment) produced by Suzuki. The vehicle is classified as a B-segment marque in the European single market, a segment referred to as a supermini in the British Isles. Prior to this, the "Swift" nameplate had been applied to the rebadged Suzuki Cultus in numerous export markets since 1984[2] and for the Japanese-market Suzuki Ignis since 2000. The Swift became its own model in 2004.[3][4] Currently, the Swift is positioned between Ignis and Baleno in Suzuki's global hatchback lineup
            The Suzuki Swift nameplate began in 1984 as an export name for the Suzuki Cultus, a supermini (or subcompact) manufactured and marketed worldwide since 1983 across three generations and four body configurations—three-door hatchback, four-door sedan, five-door hatchback and two-door convertible—and using the Suzuki G engine family. The third generation was only sold in North America; the second generation remained in production for other markets across the world.

The Swift was marketed in the Japanese domestic market (JDM) as the Cultus and elsewhere as the Suzuki SA310, Suzuki Swift, Suzuki Forsa, Chevrolet Swift, Chevrolet Sprint and Sprint Metro, Geo and Chevrolet Metro, Pontiac Firefly, Maruti 1000, Holden Barina and Subaru Justy. Versions of the second generation Cultus were also produced until 2007 in India and the car remained in production until 2016 in Pakistan and China
In Japan, the Swift nameplate was introduced in 2000 as a replacement for the Suzuki Cultus. Outside Japan, the "Suzuki Ignis" name was used. Both three- and five-door hatchback body styles were offered, although the three-door was not offered as part of the regular lineup in Japan.

The Swift was powered by a new generation of Suzuki inline-four gasoline engines, the M family. Engine displacements of 1.3- and 1.5-litres were offered, both with a five-speed manual transmission or optional four-speed automatic. The vehicle was available with either front- or four-wheel drive. Vehicles fitted with the 1.3-litre engine were designated HT51S, with the 1.5-litre version assigned HT81S.[5]

The three-door body variant formed the basis of the Swift Sport in Japan, or Ignis Sport in export markets. Introduced in 2003, it featured redesigned bumpers and was fitted with a higher-output version of the 1.5-litre engine, producing 115 PS (85 kW; 113 hp). The Sport ceased production in 2005, with the regular Swift (1.3-liter SE-Z trim) remaining until 2006 and sold side by side with the first generation global version Swift since November 2004.In Japan, the Swift nameplate was introduced in 2000 as a replacement for the Suzuki Cultus.
